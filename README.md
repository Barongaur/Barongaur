# Hello there!
I'm Anish. I am an aspiring junior DevOps Engineer by day and a dreamer by night( Remind me to tell you about my terrible puns later on.)

## About me
:computer:	I am currently neck deep in advancing my knowledge of cloud computing. Having your head in the clouds isn't such a bad thing anymore.

:books: The DevOps Handbook, The Coming Wave and the occasional re-reads of the Sprawl Trilogy.

:musical_score:	Darksynth seems to have recaptured my interest and I find myself most of the time listening to the likes of Extra Terra and Timecop 1983 in the background.

:game_die: Does a 20th run of Baldurs Gate 3 count as one? Same for Cyberpunk 2077
