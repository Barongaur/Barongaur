# Hello there!
I'm Anish (I know you wanted to hear "General Kenobi!!" but that my friends is in a Galaxy Far Far away). I am a Red Hat, AWS, Google and ISC2 Certified system administrator and an aspiring DevOps Engineer.

## About me
:computer:	Busy as a bee with blinders on. I am in process of getting my Red Hat Certified Engineer and Certified Kubernetes Administrator Certifications. At the same time, I have my head in the clouds as I learn more about AWS and Azure.

:books: The DevOps Handbook, The Coming Wave and the occasional re-reads of the Sprawl Trilogy.

:musical_score:	Darksynth seems to have recaptured my interest and I find myself most of the time listening to the likes of Extra Terra and Timecop 1983 in the background.

:game_die: Does a 20th run of Baldurs Gate 3 count as one? Same for Cyberpunk 2077. I am actively looking for cyberpunk TTRPG campaigns as well, feel free to message me if you know of one.

:mechanical_arm:	I am a huge advocate of keeping active and while I do not powerlift like I used to anymore, you will always find me encouraging others to hit the gym, the track, the trail or anything that will keep you healthy and sane.
